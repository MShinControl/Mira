### Deployed on http://www.taskmanager.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ 

### Project:
A functional task management board similar to Trello and Jira.

### Final Deliverable:
The deliverable should be a link to a public git repository that we can check out.
The app should be a React application that can be run locally. We will run and test on the latest version of Chrome (macOS) to assess functionality.
If you want, you can use a style guide of choice (Material Design, Ant Design, etc.) and manage State however you see fit.

### Project Specs and Requirements:
- User should be able to add a Card to a column by clicking “Add another card” - When you add another card, you are able to add in Description Text
- User can edit the text in a Card by hovering over the Card and clicking the Edit pencil icon (this can just be text)
- When editing a card (Diag. 2, below) the background goes dark and you can edit, save, and delete the card.
- User can re-arrange the order of the Cards in a Column
- User can also move a Card from one column to another
- User can also edit the Names of the Columns by clicking on the Name

### How to run:
- Make sure to install all dependencies with `npm install`
- Run `npm start` to see a Create-React-App running in the browser.
